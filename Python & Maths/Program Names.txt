I will be storing problems of mathematics getting solved through Python. 

#M0001: calculation of z=y+(y/(x+(y/(x+...)))) till n steps, recursive and formulated approach.
#M0002: recursive and iterative calculation of factorial.
#M0003: recursive and iterative calculation of n^p.
#M0005: generate n terms of fibonacci series iteratively.
#M0004: return factors of integer passed.
#M0006: return value of nCr when n and r are passed to function.
#M0007: convert radians to degrees and degrees to radians.
#M0008: return count of odd & even numbers in passed range (x,y) iteratively and efficiently.
#M0009: function checks if passed argument is Harshad number or not.
#M0010: function prints sum of digits of passed argument.
